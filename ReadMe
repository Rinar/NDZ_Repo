Made some debug - had found big mistake in "preparing" for media record... Will search solution. 
Insert some exception for prevent crushing.

Found the reason of mistake. It was permissions for sdcard. Fixed, but app still does not work(on VM).

Now record part of app worked correctly except for the numerous experiments.
Change name of package. Change mode of creation file (now it `is temporary and independent for path of storage).

Tried to work with creation file. Have idea to change way of capture... Streaming audio seems to be better solution for this task (Maybe).

Have worked with this fft-class. Met with "null-exception" during running FFT. (however keep it in listing)
Included new FFT-class from that used in Audalyzer app (from  http://projects.javatic.net/p/chordroid/source/tree/634d5381bdca4d4c4f3d63f7f501c9f20df4c4fb/src/ca/uol/aig/fftpack)
Have problem with using him in my app. Still have wanting to change way of capturing, but not shure why...
